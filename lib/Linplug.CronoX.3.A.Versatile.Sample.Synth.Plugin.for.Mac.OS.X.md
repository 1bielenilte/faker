# Linplug CronoX 3: A Versatile Sample Synth Plugin for Mac OS X
 
Linplug CronoX 3 is a virtual instrument plugin that offers four different types of synthesis: analogue, time, loop and wavetable. It can load any sample and transform it into a new sound with its powerful modulation and effects features. It supports both VST and AU formats and runs on Mac OS X v10.5 or later.

CronoX 3 has a flexible architecture with four generator modules that can be mixed into two filters. Each generator can use one of the four synthesis modes: analogue, time, loop or wavetable. The analogue mode simulates classic subtractive synthesis with an oscillator, a noise generator and a ring modulator. The time mode allows real-time time-stretching and pitch-shifting of any sample. The loop mode lets you load up to 64 samples per generator and modulate their loop points and start points individually. The wavetable mode uses a special algorithm to create wavetable-like sounds from any sample.
 
The plugin also features a free filter with a continuously adjustable and modulatable filter type, ranging from low-pass to high-pass to band-pass to notch. There are two multimode stereo filters with modulatable cutoff frequency and resonance, as well as seven ADSFR-type envelopes and four independent LFOs for controlling various parameters. The modulation matrix offers 10 routings for connecting 30 sources and 56 destinations. You can also use MIDI controllers to control CronoX 3, thanks to its MIDI learn function.
 
CronoX 3 comes with six effects units that can be used simultaneously: delay, chorus, phaser, filter, flanger, gator, stereo enhancer, parametric EQ and crusher. You can also use the stereo and 5.1 support to mix the generators and filters in surround sound. The plugin has a built-in arpeggiator with up to 32 steps and various modes. It also supports microtonal tuning with TUN/Scala files.

One of the strengths of CronoX 3 is its ability to create complex and evolving sounds with its modulation options. You can use the modulation matrix to assign any of the 30 sources to any of the 56 destinations, with adjustable amounts and curves. You can also use the two modulation envelopes to shape any parameter over time. The LFOs have various waveforms and can be synced to the host tempo or run freely. You can also adjust the delay, attack, decay and symmetry of the LFOs for more variety.
 
CronoX 3 also has a powerful arpeggiator that can turn any sound into a rhythmic pattern. You can program up to 32 steps with adjustable note length, velocity, octave and chord. You can also choose from different modes such as up, down, random, as played or chord. The arpeggiator can be synced to the host tempo or run at its own speed. You can also use the swing and shuffle controls to add some groove to your patterns.
